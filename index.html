            <p>As punishment for a past rebellion, each district is forced to provide one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to act as "tributes" in the Games. These 24 teenagers are placed in a vast, custom-designed arena and forced to fight to the death on live, nationwide television, with the sole survivor winning riches for themselves and their home district.
            The main story follows Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old girl from the coal-mining District 12, who volunteers to take her younger sister's place in the 74th Hunger Games. Along with her fellow male tribute, Peeta Mellark, she must use her survival instincts and sharp archery skills to navigate the brutal competition and the political machinations of the Capitol. Katniss's acts of defiance in the arena inadvertently spark a revolution across Panem.</p>
