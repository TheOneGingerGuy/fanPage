When her sister Prim is chosen, Katniss volunteers in her place. Alongside fellow tribute Peeta Mellark, Katniss survives the brutal arena using her hunting skills and sharp instincts. Their apparent romance wins public favor, and by threatening joint suicide, they force the Capitol to allow two winners—an act that unknowingly sparks rebellion.</p>
