        <p class="description">Katniss begins as a poor teenager from District 12 whose main goal is to protect her family, especially her sister Prim. When she volunteers for the Hunger Games, she becomes a tribute, then a victor, and eventually the symbol of a revolution. Over the course of the series, her role evolves from survivor → unwilling celebrity → rebel icon → decisive agent in Panem’s future.She is named the “Mockingjay,” a living symbol used by the rebellion to inspire hope and unity against the Capitol. Though often manipulated by both sides, Katniss consistently acts based on her personal sense of justice rather than politics.</p>

        <p class="description">Peeta Mellark is the male tribute from District 12 and Katniss’s counterpart in the Hunger Games. Unlike Katniss, who relies on survival skills and independence, Peeta is strategic, empathetic, and media-savvy. He is skilled at manipulating public perception, especially through his charm, honesty, and ability to connect with people emotionally.Throughout the series, Peeta’s role evolves from tribute → ally → symbol of hope → survivor coping with trauma. He provides a moral and emotional balance to Katniss’s pragmatism and often serves as a reminder of humanity in the midst of violence.</p>
